This ensures that you will always have the subscribed bandwidth for your business's mission critical applications.</span></li>

Hence, you may not receive the actual bandwidth that you subscribed to. With YES DIA, you will always have the bandwidth that you are subscribed to as it is reserved for your usage, with assured availability of 99.5%. </span></li>
                                                        <li>Is there any contention ratio for YES DIA?<br />

        However, you are not allowed to downgrade the bandwidth during the commitment period. You can only do so after the completion of the commitment period.</span></li>
