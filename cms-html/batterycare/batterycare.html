        </span>
    </div>

    <div><br />
        <strong>1. How do I charge my YES Altitude 3 smartphone?</strong><br /> YES Altitude 3 smartphones use Lithium-ion batteries. To extend your battery’s performance, we recommend the following:<br /> • Use the original charger and charging cable
        provided with your smartphone.<br /> • Do not leave your smartphone charging for long periods of time.<br /> • Do not use your smartphone while charging.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>2. Why do smartphones heat up? </strong><br /> Smartphones could heat up due to several factors, including the following:<br /> • Long-running videos or anything that keeps your screen on for long periods of time such as video conference
        (Google Meet, Zoom, etc.) or gaming.<br /> • Multiple active apps running in the background (Tip: on the YES Altitude 3 smartphone, you can remove background apps simply by clicking the menu button twice (in the bottom right of all the screens)
        and click "CLEAR ALL").<br />
        <br />
        <strong>3. What is a normal operating temperature for a smartphone? </strong><br /> Our fingertips are a pretty good judge - if you feel the device is warm or hot to the touch, it is time to let our smartphone (and ourselves) catch a break.&nbsp;<br
        />
        <br />
        <strong>4. What should I do if my smartphone is hot?</strong><br /> If your smartphone is warm to the touch, please ensure there is sufficient airflow around it. We also suggest the following:<br /> • Keep your apps up to date<br /> • Clean up
        background apps (clicking the menu button twice (in the bottom right of all the screens) and click "CLEAR ALL")<br /> • Turn on Battery Saver Mode<br /> • Turn the brightness down<br /> • Check the charging cable – a faulty charging cable can
        cause the charging unit to malfunction. Please ensure the cable is in good condition and change it if necessary<br /> • Do not leave your smartphone on the dashboard in your car, or by the window with direct sunlight<br />
        <br />
        <strong>5. How would I know if my smartphone has a swollen battery? </strong><br /> Open the back cover once in a while, and if the battery looks puffy or the centre feels soft, it is likely to be swollen.<br /> Once swollen, the battery should
        not be used. Please take it out from the smartphone carefully (let it cool off if it is warm to the touch) and properly dispose of it.</div>
